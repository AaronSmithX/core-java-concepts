# FlexCode Core Java Concepts

This repository contains examples of concepts in Module 1 through Module 4, when we focus on the Java language itself.

In Eclipse, you can right click and run any file with a name ending in "App" as those files each have a `main` method.

## Setup

<!-- This repo also contains examples of TESTING, which means it uses JUnit and Hamcrest, which means you will need to bring in those dependencies with Gradle.-->

After cloning this project, run `gradle eclipse` to set it up before importing it into Eclipse.
